Hey look it's all the config stuff for my computer! This is mostly here just so I can easily set things up when I need to, but maybe someone else is interested in looking at it too. In that case, howdy stranger! Sorry about the mess...

# Installing

This repository is set up to be used to [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). You can install packages like so:

```
stow [PACKAGE NAME]
```

E.g. `stow i3` would install the i3 package.

You can also install every package at once with `stow *`.
